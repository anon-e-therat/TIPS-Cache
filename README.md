TIPS Simulator Flesh-Out
============================================

This project is made to fill out the TIPS simulator for MIPS logic. It
correctly implements the cache simulator for a level 1 (L1) cache. This
was coded as part of a computer architecture school project and should not
be used in production.

This code can be used as-is in the TIPS simulator. Simply
download the ZIP file from the right hand side of this page, then
unpack it and run `make`. Then run `./tips`
